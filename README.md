# Weather Applicationüå§Ô∏è
## Project Overview
The Weather Application is a dynamic web page designed to display the current weather for a specified location. Utilising a weather API, this application fetches and displays real-time weather data. Users can view the current weather conditions for any location in the world of their choice. The application also presents a real-time clock that updates every second to ensure users have been provided with the most accurate and up-to-date information. 
## Features
+ Current Weather Display: Shows the weather conditions for any location in the world.
+ Real-Time Clock: Continuously updates to show the current time, updated every second.
+ Dynamic Weather Data: Fetches data from the Open-Meteo API, including temperature, weather conditions, and more.
+ User Location Input: Allows users to enter any location to fetch the corresponding weather data.
+ Version Control: Employed Git and GitHub for version control, ensuring efficient collaboration and code management.
## Achievements
+ Real-Time Data Fetching: Successfully integrates with the Open-Meteo API to provide up-to-date weather information.
+ Real-Time Clock Implementation: Implements a real-time clock using setInterval to update the time every second.
+ User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive interface for users to input their location and view current weather conditions.
## Technologies Used
+ React: JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
+ Open-Meteo API: Provides weather data for various locations.
+ JavaScript: Programming language used for application logic and API interactions, including functions like setInterval to continuously update the current time every second.
+ JSON: Data format used for exchanging information between the server and client.
+ AJAX: Technique used for asynchronously fetching data from the API.
+ CSS: Styling language used to ensure the application is visually appealing and responsive.
